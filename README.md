### [Excel](https://excel.abhiarya.in)

This application mimics the functionality of a basic spreadsheet. It allows users to work with formulas, perform text and cell formatting, and supports importing and exporting data in JSON format. The application also includes cycle detection in formulas.

This project was part of my learning journey, where I understood the importance of data structures and algorithms and how they are applied in real-world projects.
